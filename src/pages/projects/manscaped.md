Most recently I've been working with the insanely talented team **MANSCAPED**.

I started there in September 2019 as a full stack developer and we've grown from a small team of 3 developers to a team of 10+ building tons of applications and solutions
to help the D2C business grow.

All along the way I fell in love with working in eCommerce and watching a smaller/mid size company grow exponentially knowing I contributed.
