I was originally contracted to help with a few small projects for the Children's Advocacy Group in 2015. I ended up building a full fledged Rails web application for them that could be maintained via a portal.

5 years later I volunteered to come back and help them modernize their site and make it easier to maintain. I ended up rebuilding the site from scratch using Gatsby and Contentful as a CMS and it's been a huge success.

They now have full control over their site and can easily publish changes via the CMS without having to write a single line of code.
