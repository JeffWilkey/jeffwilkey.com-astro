After poking around on CodePen I found some cool examples of orbiting planets and decided to make my own version that captured our Solar System.

I also added a few more features like a sun and hover states that highlight a certain planet's orbit or brightening the sun. Then after posting to dev.to I decided to add Pluto after seeing a couple people mention it.

This was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about CSS animations. Then one cool touch I tried to apply was to do some math to actually make the planets orbit the sun at the "correct" speed. Obviously this is not to scale but it was a fun challenge to figure out how to map the speed of the planets to the speed of the animation.

All in all after 4 years this is still one of my favorite little projects I've worked on and it's cool to see it still getting some attention on CodePen.
