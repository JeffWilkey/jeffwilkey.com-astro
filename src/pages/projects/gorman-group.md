Our team at Future Foundry was brought on to create Gorman Group's internal website. Gorman Group is a recruiting firm which sources high-level executives from Brazil.

We worked with a designer who was separately brought on, named [Alizah](https://alizah.com/). This site was built in React with a Ruby on Rails backend, using Docker for DevOps, Elastic Search for the search functionality.

I contributed to the entire stack of the project throughout development. However, I was mainly responsible for building the API as well as an administration panel the client could use to different aspects of the application.

In the photo is Gorman Group's website. Our work is not pictured because it is internal to our client.
