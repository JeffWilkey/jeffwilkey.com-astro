## Astro

I've always been a sucker for newer stuff. and Astro is a newer static site generator that I've seen pop up a lot lately and I wanted to give it a try. Found it to be super easy to use and things are pretty well documented. I'm still learning the ins and outs of it, but it's super easy to get started with and just play around.

The thing I like about it most is the ability to build components **_super_** quickly. I always find I'm having the most fun when I'm able to just code and not really have to get bogged down by a framework.

**5/5 would recommend trying it outüëç**

## Tailwind ...

I'm a fan of tailwind but decided against it for this project since it's been awhile since I've gotten to write any CSS so I wanted to get back into it.
