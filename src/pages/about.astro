        Hi, I'm Jeff. I'm a web developer and am passionate about what I do. I
        love finding creative solutions to tough problems and really enjoy
        working with others to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been in the field for about 8 years now and have learned a lot
        since then. I've built tons of web and mobile applications as a
        full-stack developer with different clients all around the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, most recently I've been working with the insanely talented team
        MANSCAPED.I started there about {currentYear - startYear} years ago as a
        full stack developer and we've grown from a small team of 3 developers to
        a team of 10+ building tons of applications and solutions to help the D2C
        business grow.All along the way I fell in love with working in eCommerce
        and watching a smaller/mid size company grow exponentially knowing I contributed.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I'm working on personal projects and learning new things in
        my free time and I'm always looking for new opportunities.
